      <h1>
  
  Pearls of the FOSE 2010, from the back of an envelope
  
</h1>
<p>I've been to <a href='http://fose.ethz.ch/'>The Future of Software Engineering Symposium</a> at ETH Zurich. It was amazing to meet in person some of the true legends of our field. Here's a random set of entertaining notes I took.</p><h1 id="e._gamma_re_c._alexander%27s_books_on_pattern_language%3A">E. Gamma re C. Alexander's books on pattern language:</h1><p>— Those are the books we'd like to have on our shelves. Some of us even read them. I didn't.</p><h1 id="d._parnas%3A">D. Parnas:</h1><p>— “Requirements” is not a list. It's a predicate.</p><p>— …But the open source code I looked at is crap! (in response to Gamma's offer to learn good design from OSS projects)</p><p>— Did the people who spell well learn it from a spell checker? (re a verification tool driving the coding)</p><h1 id="m._broy%3A">M. Broy:</h1><p>— Software engineering is in a much better shape than one would think after attending this conference.</p><h1 id="n._wirth%3A">N. Wirth:</h1><p>— Everyone get the language they deserve.</p><h1 id="a._zeller%3A">A. Zeller:</h1><p>— If you need a lot of versatile bug samples for your static analysis, simply take AspectJ.</p><p>— How do we solve anything fundamental in software engineering now? Everyone takes his tool of choice, like a hammer, and we together beat the problem until it's smashed.</p><h1 id="b._meyer%3A">B. Meyer:</h1><p>— JUnit isn't an automated testing, it's just an automated tests running.</p><h1 id="p._cousot%3A">P. Cousot:</h1><p>— Programmers live in a virtual world, without responsibility.</p><h1 id="y._gurevich%3A">Y. Gurevich:</h1><p>— The future isn’t what it used to be.</p><p>— For a breakthrough in software engineering we need something like what quantum physics is for physics; something where our intuition is of no value.</p><p>— Everyone keeps checking if his program is correct, while the answer is obvious: it isn't.</p><h1 id="p.s.">P.S.</h1><p>Such a fanboy :)</p><p><img src="assets/Parnas-signature.jpg" alt="D. Parnas has signed his epic paper for me" /></p>
