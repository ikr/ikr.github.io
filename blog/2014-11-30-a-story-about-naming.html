      <h1>
  
  A story about naming
  
</h1>
<p>Long time ago I contracted for a company selling digital photo prints. Me and a colleague of mine developed an MS Windows application in which you would drop some JPEG-s, crop, rotate them, fix some red eyes, and then ultimately order prints in various formats. And by Windows I mean the just released XP &ndash; that's what <i>I</i> had back then; while our lowest supported OS was Windows 98.</p><p>There was a twist though: the <i>customer</i> wanted a <i>custom</i> look for the application. Very, very custom. So custom that we had to cover the whole window client area with bitmaps. Now, add to that numerous states of controls: disabled, pressed, checked, disabled and checked, mouse hovering, etc. Then, there was no transparency support for bitmaps, as there was no GDI+ for Windows 98 and Windows 2000. Therefore, graphic designers had to draw every text on every background, for every of the 4 supported languages in Photoshop, with their nice font, and then give it to us as... correct, a bitmap.</p><p>Ever since I've never had a project with accidental complexity that high. A tiniest thing required tons of work and rigorous attention to details. But that's not the point of the story, actually.</p><p>So, as you can imagine we've ended up with <i>thousands</i> of bitmaps and color constants. They were stored, of course, as <i>resources</i> in resource DLL-s, one DLL per language, and their ID-s were aliased with <code>#define</code>-s in a long <code>resource.h</code> file. That was a pretty standard setup for the old-school Win32 apps. On top of the resources we had an object-oriented widgets implementation, often doubling in the object properties in <code>camelCase</code> the <code>CONST&#95;CASE</code> names from <code>resource.h</code>. Now, the interesting part was how we named our visual elements. Here are some examples for you:</p><ul><li><code>lightBlueBackground</code></li><li><code>redButtonDisabledText</code></li><li><code>blueFrameLeftTopCorner</code></li><li><code>yellowishGradientInTheCenter</code></li></ul><p>Thus, the names reflected what color or pattern elements had, or where they were located in the GUI layout. We often reused the same visual element in multiple widgets. A light blue gradient could easily appear in a dozen of different places.</p><p>After a few months we've successfully shipped the first version, and plenty of end users could appreciate our unique and fresh custom look. He-he. That was sarcasm. Frankly, I was quite glad it was all over.</p><p>Then, about a year later we've got a call. The customer was really excited: they were expanding to Scandinavian market &ndash; buying a Swedish, a Norwegian, and a Finnish digital photos printing company. Oh yeah, and they were also running a total re-branding in Switzerland. They were even going to change the company name. Now guess whose brilliant ordering software they wanted to use for all the new brands... While you're at it, guess how many of the <code>lightBlueGradient</code>-s stayed either light or blue in any of the new brands' GUI-s. Yep, you guessed it right: almost none. Moreover, many visual elements used in several places in the current version &ndash; just because it was all, say, yellowish &ndash; were going to get a completely different look in the new revision. And finally, let's not forget that instead of 4 bitmap localizations we were going to support 7. What an epic surprise...</p><p>So, the next time you get an idea of calling something a <code>redHeader</code> or a <code>rightColumn</code>, may be just stop for a moment, and think if that's really the best you can do.</p>
